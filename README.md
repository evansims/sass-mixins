# Evan's SASS Mixins

A collection of my favorite custom (SASS)[http://sass-lang.com/] mixins.

## Requirements
These scripts were designed to fit into my design workflow, which makes use of :

- (SASS)[http://sass-lang.com/]
- (Compass)[http://compass-style.org/]
- (Foundation 5)[http://foundation.zurb.com/] (or at least it's (_functions.scss file)[https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/_functions.scss])

## Medium.com Style Underlines
This mixin is intended to replicate Medium.com's super sexy underlines style, (elaborated in fantastic detail by Marcin Wichary here.)[https://medium.com/designing-medium/7c03a9274f9]. This mixin is a bit of a remix based on several (other's)[https://github.com/Team-Sass/toolkit#underline] (attempts)[http://codepen.io/ghepting/pen/tLnHK/], with my own added contributions.

Example:
![Underline Example](/../screenshots/screenshots/underline.png?raw=true "Underline Example")

Usage: ``@include underline(#fff, #ccc)``
Parameters (in order):
- Background color; defaults to #fff.
- Underline color; defaults to #ccc.
- Distance of underline from text base; defaults to 2.
- Width of underline; defaults to 1.
- Clear descenders true/false; defaults to yes.
